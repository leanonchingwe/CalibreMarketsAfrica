This article will cover the basics of how a trade begins and what happens before, during, and after a trade.

The first step in a trade is for an order to be submitted by a broker or trader on behalf of their client. This order is then sent over the wire to an interbank where it’s routed to one or more counterparties that are willing to take on the risk associated with it.

They ensure that trades are settled, and they monitor the financial health of their members.

They do this by matching buyers and sellers and then ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations. Clearing houses also act as a buffer between buyers and sellers to prevent one party from defaulting on its obligation to the other.

Clearing houses have been around for centuries, but they have become more important in recent years because of increased trading volume and complexity.
