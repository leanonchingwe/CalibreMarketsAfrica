Gaining a sense of and comprehension of market dynamics is essential for successfully profiting from short-term fluctuations. This is particularly important in forex trading because order flow primarily determines intraday price action.

## How to trade double zeros intraday

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Share-Siemens.png)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fading the Double Zeros</figcaption></figure>It is impossible to search for rebounds off each support or resistance level while trading intraday and anticipate success. Increased selectivity and only entering at levels where a reaction is more likely are the keys to successful intraday trading. Trading off levels that are psychologically significant, like the double zeros or round numbers, is a smart approach to spot such possibilities. Double zeros are numbers with zeros as the last two digits. Double zero examples include 118.00 in the USD/JPY or 1.1100 in the EUR/USD. We noticed that despite the underlying trend, a currency pair would frequently bounce off double zero support or resistance levels during the day. These bounces are typically much larger and more significant than rallies.

## What makes this strategy more special.

This trading strategy is not difficult, but it necessitates that each trader acquire a strong understanding of dealing room and market participant psychology. This double zero approach has a straightforward premise. In comparison to other market participants, large banks that have access to conditional order flow are clearly superior. The order book of the bank provides them with immediate knowledge of possible responses at various price levels. This strategic information is frequently used by dealers to initiate short-term bets in their own accounts.

### How humans behave

Market participants as a whole tend to put conditional orders near or around the same levels. While stop-loss orders are usually placed just beyond the round numbers, traders will cluster their take profit orders at the round number. The reason why this occurs is because traders are humans, and humans tend to think in round numbers. As a result, take profit orders have a very high tendency of being placed at the double zero level. Since the FX market is a 24-hour continuous market, speculators also use stop and limit orders more frequently than in other markets.

Large banks with access to conditional order flow, like stops and limits, actively seek to exploit this clustering of positions to basically gun stops. The fading the double zero strategy attempts to put traders on the same side as market makers by positioning traders for a quick contra-trend move at the double zero level.

***Strategy Rules***  
**Long:**

1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below its intraday 20-period simple moving average on a 15-minute chart.
2. Enter a long position 10 to 15 pips above the figure.
3. **Place an initial protective stop 20 pips below the figure**.  
    a. *When the position is profitable by the amount risked, close half of the  
    position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to  
    breakeven.*  
    b. *Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.*

#### *Short*:

1. Identify a currency pair that is trading above its intraday 20-period simple  
    moving average on a 15-minute chart.
2. Place an initial protective stop 20 pips above the round number.
3. Short the currency pair 10 to 15 pips below the figure.
4. When the position is profitable by the amount that you risked, close half of the  
    position and move your stop on the remaining portion of the trade to breakeven.  
    Trail your stop as the price moves in your favor.

## Market Conditions

When the move occurs in less active market conditions without the influence of significant reports, this method performs well. Crosses, commodity currencies, and currency pairs with narrower trading ranges do better. Due to the relatively narrow stop loss, this approach also works in the majors but only in tranquil market conditions.

### Further Optimization

Round numbers are important because they are significant levels but if the price  
coincides with a key technical level, a reversal becomes more likely. This means the  
strategy has an even higher probability of success when other important support or  
resistance levels converge at the figure. This can be caused by moving averages, key  
Fibonacci levels or Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators.
