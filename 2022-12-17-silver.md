Silver is a precious metal that has been used for centuries in the form of coins and jewelry. It is also an important industrial metal, with many applications such as in electronics, solar panels, and water purification. The price of silver has traditionally been less volatile than other metals (like gold or copper), but it still follows the same general trends.

Silver can be found in two main forms:

1\) Silver Bullion – This is silver that has been made into bars or coins to be traded on the open market;

2\) Silver Coins – These are pieces of silver currency that are used as legal tender by governments around the world.
