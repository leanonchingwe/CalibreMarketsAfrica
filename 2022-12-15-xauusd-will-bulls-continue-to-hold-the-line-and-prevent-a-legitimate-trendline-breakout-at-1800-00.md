The price of XAU/USD is impacted by bearish RSI divergence, candlestick formation, and US Dollar recovery.

For a new stimulus, US data and monetary policy meetings of the BOE, SNB, and ECB will be important.

While the US Dollar tries to recover from a six-month low despite traders’ reevaluation of the Federal Reserve (Fed) comments on early Thursday, the gold price (XAU/USD) remains under pressure at approximately $1,800.  
The cautious atmosphere in front of significant central bank announcements may have also helped the XAU/USD selling.
