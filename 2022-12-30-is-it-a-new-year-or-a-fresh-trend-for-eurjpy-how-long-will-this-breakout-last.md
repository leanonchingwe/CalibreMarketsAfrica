The yen is a popular choice for carrying trades and other speculative positions, which often pushes it higher during times of market stress and global uncertainty. The marketâ€™s recent move has been defined by trade tensions, which means that the yen is likely to remain in demand in the near term. The euro, meanwhile, is under pressure from concerns about the health of the European economy. Rates uncertainty is also weighing on the currency. These factors are likely to keep the ***EUR/JPY*** under pressure in the near term.
