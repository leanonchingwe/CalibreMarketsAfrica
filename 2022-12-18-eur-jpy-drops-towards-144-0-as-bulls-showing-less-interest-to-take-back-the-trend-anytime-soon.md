A declining trend is still in place at the moment, with trading below 144.0 this morning.

This is not the first time we see a certain buffer level being tested and broken before reverting to previous highs. As such, we canâ€™t say for sure that there will be any significant changes in the short term as both currencies are being heavily influenced by macro-economic factors like Euro Area growth or Brexit.
