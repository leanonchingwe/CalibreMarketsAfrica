  </script></div>Today, the price of gold is at $1800 per ounce.

In the[ ***short-term***](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/sample-page/), gold prices are under pressure because of a stronger US dollar and expectations that the it will set new prices for year-end.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/today-1024x430.png)</figure>Gold prices have been on a downward trend since August 2022. This trend can be attributed to many factors, such as high world inflation and expectations that the ***[Federal Reserve](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/22/global-economy-is-slowly-recovering/)*** will drop interest rates by half before year’s end. Today, the price of gold is at $1800 per ounce. In the short-term, gold prices are under pressure because of these factors and in the long term it can still possibly grow till $1812 per ounce because it has been proven psychological resistance and ***Federal Reserve*** year-end release.
