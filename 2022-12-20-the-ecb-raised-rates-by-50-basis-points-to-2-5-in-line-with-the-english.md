Current gains are supported by the possibility of additional ECB rate hikes following Christine Lagardeâ€™s upbeat comments.

The Chinese government promised to help the second-largest economy in the world after stringent Covid 19 policies that halted development, which led to a fall in the dollar this week amid optimistic market sentiment.

.

EUR/USD rose 0.5% to 1.0638 after falling 0.4% on Friday, the second consecutive loss due to profit-taking from a six-month high of 1.0736.

Last week, the euro gained 0.5% against the dollar, the third weekly gain in a month, as concerns about a widening policy gap between Europe and the US faded.

According to Lagarde, inflation remains a significant risk that requires significant effort to control.
