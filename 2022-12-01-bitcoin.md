## Capitalization: $323.1 billion

  
The initial cryptocurrency is Bitcoin (BTC), which Satoshi Nakamoto created in 2009. BTC operates on a blockchain, which is a ledger that records transactions and is shared across a network of thousands of computers, like the majority of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is kept secure and protected from fraudsters because updates to the distributed ledgers have to be validated by cracking a cryptographic puzzle, a procedure known as “proof of work.”

As Bitcoin has gained popularity, its price has risen. The price of a single bitcoin in May 2016 was roughly $500. On December 20, 2022, the cost of one bitcoin was approximately $16,795. That is an increase of 3,259%.
