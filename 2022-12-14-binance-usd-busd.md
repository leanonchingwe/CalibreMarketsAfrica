## **Market cap: $18.34 billion**

Paxos and[ Binance](https://www.facebook.com/calibremarkets) founded the stablecoin known as Binance USD (BUSD) to provide a cryptocurrency backed by the dollar. Paxos has enough US dollars to cover the whole supply of BUSD in order to preserve this value. Similar to other stablecoins, BUSD allows users and [traders](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/20/xauusd-resume-with-trend-forrmig-a-new-high/) to transact with other crypto assets while reducing the risk of volatility.
