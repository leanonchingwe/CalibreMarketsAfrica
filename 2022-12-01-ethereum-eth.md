## Capitalization: $148.0 billion

  
Because of its potential applications, including so-called “smart contracts” that automatically execute when certain conditions are met and non-fungible tokens, Ethereum—which is both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform—is a darling among programmers (NFTs).

Ethereum has also grown [incredibly fast.](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/09/how-to-become-successful-forex-trader/) Its price increased by 10,897% between April 2016 and the end of December 2022, from around $11 to about $1210.
