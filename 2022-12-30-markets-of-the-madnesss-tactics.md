This week’s Wednesday saw a significant decline in the stock market. On Thursday, it went up considerably. And no one will be surprised if it closes substantially up or down today, the last trading day of the year. That’s because [stocks](https://calibremarkets.africa/) haven’t followed a consistent decline to get there, even though the market will end the year about 20% lower than it started (according to the S&amp;P 500 index). Instead, they’ve been experiencing an incredibly turbulent ride, alternating between periods of optimism and doom, and frequently adding or deleting trillions of dollars in market value in just a few short weeks.

It initially decreased by roughly 10% in a matter of weeks before increasing by 18% over the following two months. It then dropped precipitously once more, this time by 16 percent in little more than a month, but climbed back up by approximately 15 percent by the start of December before finally dropping by only 6 or 7 percent by the end of the month. Over the period, there were no significant economic advancements. However, 2022 will be remembered as the s[ixth-most turbulent yea](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/27/the-world-economy-is-currently-expanding-but-the-federal-government-has-no-idea-what-its-growth-rate-will-be-in-2023/)r since 1929, according to Goldman Sachs.

Explaining stock market movements is typically a fool’s errand. But the combination of a sharp decrease and several ups and downs that we’ve witnessed this year has a logical underpinning. The fundamentals of the economy underwent a significant change that contributed to the collapse, most notably the continuously rising interest rates and the outlook for corporate profit growth.
