Unlike some other forms of [cryptocurrency](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/crypto_trade.jpg), Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.
