The GBP/CHF currency pair is currently in a downtrend, with the bears in control of the market. However, there are signs that the bulls are starting to gain some traction, and they may soon break the trendline to the upside.

The current situation in GBPCHF makes it difficult to continue selling along with the trend. Currently, 1,10943 is a support level, and bulls are pulling the price to the trendline. However, the bears are still in control of the market and they may soon push the price back down.
