In the forex market, everything is somewhat interconnected, so being aware of the direction and strength of this relationship can be advantageous; it has the potential to be an excellent trading tool. The basic message is that it can be quite advantageous to consider how pairs move relative to one another, unless you just wish to trade one pair at a time. We employ [correlation analysis ](https://www.facebook.com/calibremarkets)to do this.

## What is correlation analysis.

Correlations (analysis) are calculations based on [pricing data](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/sample-page/), and these numbers can help gauge the relationships that exist between different currency pairs. The information that the numbers provide can be a good aid for any traders who want to diversify their portfolio, double up on positions without investing in the same currency pair, or just get an idea of how much risk their trades are opening them up to. If used correctly, this method has the potential to maximize gains, gauge exposure, and help prevent counterproductive trading.

## Positive/Negative Correlationsâ€”What They Mean  
and How to Use Them

Strong or weak correlations between pairs might exist for days, weeks, months, or even years. A correlation number essentially calculates an estimate of how frequently these pairs move in the same direction or in the opposite direction over a predetermined amount of time. Any correlation calculation will be in decimal form, and the closer it is to 1, the more closely the two currencies are related. Negative correlations can be equally as helpful in determining how similar two pairs are as positive correlations.

## Important Fact about Correlations: They Change

Anyone who has ever traded the foreign exchange market is aware of how volatile currencies are and how daily changes in sentiment and pricing reflect shifting economic realities. As a result, the most crucial thing to keep in mind while examining currency connections is that they are subject to change over time. The calculated high correlations may not still be valid next year or even the following month. If you want to employ this strategy for trading, it is crucial to stay up to date because the forex environment is constantly changing..
