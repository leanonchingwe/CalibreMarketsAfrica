A sudden increase in price frequently signals the arrival of a pennant. The flagpole or mast is the term used to describe this nearly vertical price increase.

A downward trendline representing the lower highs and an[ ascending trendline](https://www.facebook.com/calibremarkets) indicating the lower lows make up the two convergent [trendlines.](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/services/)  
A pennant forming after a sharp upward rise is thought to be a bullish pennant, but a pennant following a rapid downward move is thought to have a tendency to continue downward.
