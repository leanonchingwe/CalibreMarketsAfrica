## Introduction

Making all of your trading decisions based on a simplified, or “naked,” price chart is known as “price action trading.” This means that there shouldn’t be any lagging indicators, with the possible exception of a few moving averages to help identify dynamic support and resistance areas and trends. All financial markets produce data regarding how a market’s price has changed over various time periods, and this data is shown on price charts. Price action, which is represented on a market’s price chart as “price action,” reflects the views and actions of all participants (human or machine) trading a market within a specific period of time price action

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/today-1-1024x430.png)</figure>In order to properly trade the market, we don’t need to analyze them. The explanation is rather straightforward: all economic data and global news that affect market prices are ultimately reflected via P.A. on a market’s price chart.

Using lagging price indicators like stochastics, MACD, RSI, and others is a complete waste of time because a market’s price action reflects all factors affecting that market at any particular time. All the indications you’ll ever need to create a successful and high-probability trading strategy are provided by price movement. These signals collectively are referred to as price action trading strategies, and they offer a means of making sense of a market’s price movement and aiding in the accurate prediction of its future movement.

## Naked chart vs messy with indicators

Next, I’ve presented two charts in the examples below to show the significant contrast between a pure price action chart and one having some of the most well-liked trading indicators on it. The top chart is completely devoid of any indicators; it only displays the market’s raw P.A. Bollinger Bands, Stochastics, ADX, and MACD are four of the most used indicators, or “secondary” analytical tools as they are frequently referred to on the bottom chart.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/messy-1024x430.png)</figure>It’s important to note that the indicator-laden chart really requires you to give up some chart space in order to have the indicators at the bottom. This compels you to reduce the chart’s P.A. portion and diverts your focus from the natural P.A. to the indicators. Therefore, your concentration is not entirely on the price action of the market as it should be because you have less screen space to watch the P.A. and less screen real estate.

The answer should be very obvious if you carefully consider which of those charts is simpler to analyze and trade from. Nearly all indicators, including all of those on the chart below, stem from the underlying P.A. To put it another way, traders only increase their own variables when they add indicators to their charts; they don’t learn anything new about the market or discover any new indicators that can help them anticipate the future.

## Examples of effective strategies based on price action

Let’s now look at a few of the price action trading techniques I recommend. We are not here to show you “perfect” prior trading results; rather, we are here to teach you in an honest and realistic manner. Take note that I have included a “failed” trade setup because not every transaction will be a victory.

### *Price action can be used to identify a market’s trend*.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TREND-1024x430.png)</figure>Learning to distinguish between a trending market and a consolidating market is one of the most crucial parts of learning to trade using P.A. The highest-probability trading strategy is trading with the trend, which you MUST master if you want to have a chance of being a successful trader.

The graphs below demonstrate how price dynamics can be used to identify market trends. If a market is producing Higher Highs and Higher Lows (HH, HL), we consider it to be in an uptrend; Conversely, a downtrend is produced by Lower Highs and Lower Lows (LH, LL).

I**n the image example below, we can see how higher highs and higher lows signal an up-trend in a market:**

## How to trade with Price Action?

In what precise way then do we trade price action? The key is to develop your ability to trade P.A. setups or patterns based on market confluence levels. Now, if that currently sounds unfamiliar or unclear to you, please wait while I explain it. We must first discuss a few more issues:

The price action of a market frequently repeats itself in different patterns because of the repetitive nature of market participants and how they respond to external economic factors. These patterns are also known as price action trading methods, and there are numerous price action trading strategies that are traded in numerous ways.

The market attitude is reflected in these repeating price patterns or price action setups. That simply means that you can acquire “clues” as to where the price of a market will move next by learning to recognize price action patterns.

Take remove all the “junk” from your charts before you start price action trading. Remove ALL except the chart’s raw price bars; remove the indicators, the expert advisors, etc. If you are still using traditional bar charts and want additional information on candlesticks, check out this candlestick trading tutorial. I personally like to use candlestick charts since I believe they more strongly and dynamically express the price data of the market.

As you can see here, my favorite charts are plain black and white ones. To make the chart in Metatrader 4 look like mine below, simply right-click on the chart and modify its “properties.” Visit our metatrader 4 tutorial for more information on setting up your MT4 trading platform.

Your charts can be drawn in and you can start looking for price action setups to trade from once all the indicators and other extraneous variables have been removed.
