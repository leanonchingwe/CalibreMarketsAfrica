The cup-and-handles design  
A bullish continuation pattern is a cup and handle pattern.  
A U-shaped cup or bowl serves as the pattern’s defining feature, and the downward trend that follows is known as the handle.  
Stronger signals are given by cups with a more pronounced U-shape, while cups with a pronounced V-shape should be avoided.  
The handle’s depth shouldn’t be more than half as deep as the cup.
