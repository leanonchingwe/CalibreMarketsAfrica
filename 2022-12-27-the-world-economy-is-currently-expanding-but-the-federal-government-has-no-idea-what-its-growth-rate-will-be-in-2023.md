The global economy is currently growing, but the feds have no idea what the rate may be in 2023. The World Bank has a forecast for GDP growth of 5.5% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022, which is lower than the forecasts from the IMF and other international organizations.

This is because developing countries are more sensitive to external factors such as trade protectionism, tighter financial conditions, and slower economic growth abroad.

This article talks about how the World Bank predicts that the global economy will grow at a slower rate than previously anticipated over the next few years due to various external factors that are impacting developing countries more heavily and slowing down their economies as well as developed countries’ economies as well.
