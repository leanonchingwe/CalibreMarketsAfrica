Top-down analysis involves taking a broad view of the sectors or businesses in which investors are interested in investing. The following step involves looking at the detailed information and financial statements after identifying the companies and sectors in order to make the ultimate investing decision.

## What is the Process of Top-Down Analysis?

  
A person who is thinking about employing the top-down analysis method is eager to examine the global economy more thoroughly. Then, they identify and assess the major economic trends and choose the ones presenting the greatest potential for development. Industries that fit within those macro trends are evaluated, and then specific stocks within the workable sectors or industries are chosen. Key ideas to keep in mind:

The three components of top-down analysis are sector analysis, global trend analysis, and individual stock analysis.  
In technical analysis, the top-down analytical approach is taken into account when studying patterns over longer time periods.

## Global analysis is a component of top-down stock analysis.

Any investor who chooses top-down research starts by looking at global trends. The investor can consult the gross domestic product of both developed and developing economies to determine the state of the economy’s finances. Additionally, it’s critical for investors to determine whether there are any geopolitical risks associated with the company. The GDP of a country is an excellent indicator of its performance if it is expanding consistently. If an investor wishes to invest in a certain region, they can utilize the global analysis to set a limit on which countries are included in that region.

## Macro trend analysis and sector analysis are components of top-down stock analysis.

The macro trend analysis and sector analysis are the next steps. It is possible to identify macro trends by observing specific geographic areas inside a country that exhibit phenomenal growth. For instance, China has become one of the major food importers on the global market as a result of its expanding middle class. Investors can compare the importation rates of common foods like beef, dairy, pork, oil, and others to get a more in-depth understanding of macrotrends. Investors might analyze industries that appear advantageous in terms of investment after conducting study on macrotrends.

The investor can either opt for entering the value chain at an early stage, and emphasize on importers of commodity goods and the countries those are importing goods to China, or they can opt for moving up the value chain, and focusing on the local food processors who seek huge margins for importing goods to China. An investor can identify from where to exploit by using margins and sector-level performance levels.

## **Getting down to the stock level in top-down stock analysis**

 Investors employ a top-down analytical approach to further look at specific stocks accessible in sub-sectors that have the greatest potential once a specific sector in a workable area has been found. For instance, the investor looks for successful businesses that can meet China’s increasing need for food products. They can determine the kinds of stocks that need to be purchased by combining technical and fundamental analysis. For instance, an investor may want to target firms in the meat consumer industry that have recently surpassed the 200-day moving average and have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.. In case, more than one company meets these requirements, then the investors should go for fundamental analysis of their financial statements for comparing stats associated with the return on invested capital or any other criterion.

## **Top-down Analysis in Technical Analysis**

Top-down analysis, taking technical analysis into account, provides information on the prices of securities throughout a range of time periods, from long to short. If you are a day trader, you should concentrate on daily or weekly chart analysis to determine whether the security follows a long-term trend and its supporting and restraining levels. Then, you should make a major shift to a smaller time frame to find a workable entry point. For instance, a trader using top-down analysis can use a 15-minute chart and find a potential entry point for a long position if a security is trending more strongly on the daily chart and is showing bullish movements on the hourly chart.
