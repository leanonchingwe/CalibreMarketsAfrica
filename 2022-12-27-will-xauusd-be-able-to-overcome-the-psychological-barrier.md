In my[ previous gold analysi](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/25/xauusd-could-still-increase-till-1812-per-ounce/)s, we predicted that gold would rise indefinitely, and it has. Today, it reaches through the $1821.99 resistance level, but has since retreated back below it.

This suggests that there is potential for it to turn back down, but it will need not to break through the $1821.99 resistance level first.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/todayt-1024x430.png)</figure>But if its breaks you need to consider it as a bullish trend retracement , then start to look for buying signals.
