Flags are made up of parallel trendlines that defy the greater trend that is now in effect.  
These may be in an upward, downward, or sideways trend. The trendlines do not converge, in contrast to wedges (see below).

***Flags that slope upward will appear in a market that is heading downward, whereas flags that slope downward will appear in a market that is trending higher.***

***After the flags have shown and the price has moved through the pattern, the trend will likely continue.***
