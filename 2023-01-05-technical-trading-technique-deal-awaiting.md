Day traders have had to come up with new techniques that rely less on the level of[ demand](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/01/understand-the-forces-driving-demand-and-supply/) and more on the microstructure of the market due to the lack of volume data in the FX market. The fact that the market is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is one of the most prevalent traits that day traders attempt to exploit. The market is available for trading all day long, but the level of activity varies greatly from one trading session to the next. Trading tends to be the least active during Asian market hours. This indicates that during these hours, currencies like the EURUSD and GBPUSD typically trade in a fairly narrow range.

## Markets weights

With 41% of the overall volume, the United Kingdom is the most active trading center. By include Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy, European trading accounts for 50% of all FX trading. On the other hand, although the United States accounts for just about 19% of overall turnover, it is the second most active trading hub after the United Kingdom. This makes the London open particularly significant since it allows the bulk of market participants the chance to profit on developments or announcements that might have happened during the late [American trading ](https://one.exness-track.com/a/5uu8mqwen0)or overnight Asian sessions..

## how to be part of smart money

The British pound trades most actively against the U.S. dollar during the European and London trading hours. There is also active trading during the U.S./European overlap, but outside those time frames, the pair tends to trade relatively lightly because the majority of GBPUSD trading is done through UK and European market makers. This provides a great opportunity for day traders to capture the initial directional intraday real move that occurs within the first few hours of London trading.

Since UK and European dealers are the primary market makers for the GBPUSD, they have tremendous insight into the extent of actual  
supply and demand for the pair. The ‘‘*waiting for the real deal’’* trading strategy first sets up when interbank dealing desks survey their books at the onset of trading and use their client data to trigger close stops on both sides of the markets to gain the pip differential.

### Strategy Rules  
Longs:

1. Early European trading in GBPUSD begins around 1am NY Time, and we look  
    for the pair to make new range low of at least 25 pips above the opening price  
    (the range is defined as the price action between the Frankfurt and London  
    power hour of 6 GMT to 7 GMT NY Time).
2. Look for the pair to reverse and penetrate the high.
3. Place an entry order to buy 10 pips above the high of the range.
4. Place a protective stop no more than 25 pips away from your range high, or 35  
    pips.
5. If the position moves lower by 50 pips, close half of the position, move stop on  
    rest to breakeven, and target three times risk, or 105 pips on the remainder.

### Shorts:

1. GBPUSD opens in Europe and trades more than 25 pips above the high  
    established during the Frankfurt to London power hour.
2. Wait for the pair to reverse and penetrate the low.

## Warning

> This strategy works best following the U.S. open or after a major economic release.  
> With this strategy, you are looking for the noise in the markets to settle before  
> trading the real trend of the day.
