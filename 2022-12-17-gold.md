  </script></div>Gold has been used as money since the days of ancient Egypt. In addition to being a store of value, gold coins were used for trade between nations and for paying taxes. The price of gold was fixed at $35 per ounce from 1934 to 1971 during the Bretton Woods system. This system was created by most countries after World War II to help prevent future economic crises like the Great Depression from happening again.

The price of gold has skyrocketed recently because investors are worried about inflation, unemployment rates, and geopolitical unrest around the world affecting their investments in other assets like stocks and bonds.
