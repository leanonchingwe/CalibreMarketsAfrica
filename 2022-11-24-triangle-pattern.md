The triangle is a frequent pattern on charts. Triangles come in three varieties:

**Pattern of Symmetric Triangles**  
When the trendline connecting the lows and the line connecting the highs converge to form a triangle, it is known as a symmetric triangle.  
Such patterns are characterized by the convergence of an upward and a downward trendline.

A breakout in one direction or the other is likely, regardless of probability. However, the triangle’s orientation is neither upward nor downward because the slopes of the two lines are essentially mirror images of one another.  
If price breaks out of this pattern, it indicates that the trend present before the pattern formed will of triangle.

**pattern of ascending triangles**  
An ascending triangle is made up of a flat line, which corresponds to highs that essentially stay at the same price, and a sharp upward trendline, which corresponds to lower highs.  
In other words, the lows will increase while the highs remain stable.

According to this pattern, there will be more buying pressure than selling pressure, which will effectively lead to an upside breakthrough.

Descending triangles resemble ascending triangles turned upside down. They point downward rather than upward.  
This pattern is brought about by the upper trendline’s greater downward slope and the lower trendline’s flattened slope.

According to this pattern, sellers are outpacing buyers and driving prices lower.  
This is a bearish continuation pattern that, if it is broken, will signal a breakdown (downward breakout).
