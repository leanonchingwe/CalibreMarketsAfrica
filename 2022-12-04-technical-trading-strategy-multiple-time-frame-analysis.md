Although many traders like to range trade, transactions that capture and participate in significant market movements typically have the highest potential for profit. Mark Boucher once remarked that 20% of a marketâ€™s movements happen 70% of the time. Because no trader wants to lose sight of the big picture, multiple time frame research is especially important.
