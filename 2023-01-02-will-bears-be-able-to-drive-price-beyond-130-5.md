Recently, the USDJPY price found support near 130.5, and it appears that bulls may be prepared to resume the trend. However, in order to seize control of the market, the bears will try to push the price over $130.5.

[Stochastic (5.3.3)](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/13/complete-guide-on-technical-analysis/) is currently in an oversold area, which means that bears are in control of the market at the moment. However, bulls could take control of the market if they are able to push the price beyond 130.5.
