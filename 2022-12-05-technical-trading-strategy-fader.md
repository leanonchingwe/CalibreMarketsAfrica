The majority of the time, when presented with a potential breakout scenario, traders will position for it just to watch the trade fail horribly and the prices return to range trading. In fact, a continued move is not assured even if prices manage to break above a key level. We frequently observe interbank dealers or other traders trying to temporarily push prices beyond those levels in order to run stops if this level is highly important. Because breakout levels are critical, there is no hard and fast rule for how much force is required to carry prices past these levels and into a sustained trend.

## Medications for the illness

Consequently, traders want a process for identifying transactions that are more likely to result in a false breakout when screening out consolidation patterns. The following guidelines offer a solid framework for vetting such trades. The “waiting for the real deal” technique is modified by the fader strategy. It uses the hourly charts to locate entry levels and the daily charts to identify the range-bound environment.

### Strategy Rules  
Longs:

1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally, the ADX  
    should also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening  
    further
2. Wait for the market to break below the previous day’s low by at least 15 pips.
3. Place an entry order to buy a few ticks above the previous day’s high.
4. After getting filled, place your initial stop no more than 20 pips away.
5. Take profit on half of position when prices increase by the amount you risked;  
    move stop on remaining position to breakeven.
6. Trail the stop on the remaining position.

## Shorts:

1. Locate a currency pair whose 14-day ADX is less than 20. Ideally the ADX  
    should also be trending downward, indicating that the trend is weakening  
    further
2. Look for a move above the previous day’s high by at least 15 pips.
3. Place an entry order to sell a few ticks below the previous day’s low.
4. Once filled, place the initial protective stop no more than 20-pips below your  
    entry.
5. Protect any profits by selling half of the position when it runs 20 pips in your  
    favor.
6. Place a trailing stop on the remainder of the position.
