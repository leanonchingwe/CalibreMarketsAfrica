**Bullish trends seem to be fading, but the bulls still have trades to make before the market turns down**.

### *Key Focus*

- *Major trend is breaking to the down side*
- *Bulls can still buy untill 1815 psycho zone*

The gold market analysis is not as bullish as it was in previous weeks. The bullish trends seem to be fading, but the bulls still have trades to make before the market turns down. The price of gold has been trading sideways for a while, and it would be wise for traders to take profits at 1813.
