Ever pondered the reasons behind the variations in bitcoin exchange prices?

Other [exchanges display](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/sample-page/) various price peaks, which represent the trading activity of their members. Some of these records have values as high as $20,093.

Smart traders, often referred to as arbitrage traders,” are aware of how to profit on these minor price differences and can make a possible profit by purchasing and selling the same item on separate marketplaces.

### Crypto Arbitrage and the Law

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Legal-Cases-Against-Cryptocurrencies-and-Crypto-Exchanges.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Crypto Arbitrage and the Law</figcaption></figure>Since arbitrage seems like a simple way to turn a potential profit, it is fair to ask yourself: **is arbitrage legal?** In most countries around the world, crypto arbitrage trading is perfectly legal as it contributes to market efficiency.

Once a crypto arbitrage trader has completed their trade, they will inevitably bring additional traders to the market who are hoping to exploit the same price difference, which will eventually lead to the asset’s price becoming more balanced across markets.

However, there are exceptions. You should read up on your local laws before participating in cryptocurrency or bitcoin arbitrage trading.

When in doubt, always consult a local lawyer or accountant before proceeding

Bitcoin arbitrage traders have shifted to more effective alternatives across cryptocurrency markets. Due to the hefty fees and frequently delayed transfer times associated with bitcoin.

According to the price of crypto assets across several marketplaces, crypto arbitrage traders can exchange some cryptocurrencies for others or for more stable fiat currencies. Thanks to Binance over 150 trading pairings, for instance.

You can engage in triangle arbitrage trading. Which entails identifying price disparities between three cryptocurrencies on the exchange, through a single exchange like binance. For instance, you might use BTC to buy XLM, exchange it for ETH, and then turn ETH back into BTC.

## **Decentralized Finance Arbitrage**

  
As a result of the development of decentralized [finance](https://www.instagram.com/calibre_africa), there are now decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve. Are ones that are managed by a global network of computers rather than a single operator (DeFi).

Traders are able to identify arbitrage opportunities in pools that undergo a price slippage due to massive transactions when utilized in combination with a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance.
