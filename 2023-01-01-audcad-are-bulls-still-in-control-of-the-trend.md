The [AUDCAD](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/sample-page/) currency pair represents the value of the Australian dollar against the Canadian dollar. The value of the AUDCAD increased in market closing last week after a brief pullback and retest successfully covered the price. A new high is already set, and when the price breaks through 0.93286, we can begin to consider it a trend resumption.

Elliott waves are used by technical analysts to predict market movements by identifying patterns in market data. If this is the case, then the current trend could continue for some time.

So far, the bulls seem to be in control of the trend. However, it is always important to be aware of potential risks. If the market begins to turn and the price starts to fall, then this could signal the end of the trend.

Only time will tell if the bulls can continue to control the trend. In the meantime, it is important to keep an eye on the market and be prepared for any potential changes.
