### What is a market?

> A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The buyers as a group determine the demand for the product, and the sellers as a group determine the supply of the product.

**A market that is competitive has lots of buyers and many sellers so that the impact of any one on the market price is minimal**

## The Demand Cuve: The Relationship between Price  
and Quantity Demanded

  
The quantity demanded of any good is the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. As we will see, many things determine the quantity demanded of any good, but when analyzing how markets work, one determinant plays a central role-the price of the good.

You might buy frozen yogurt  
instead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20 per scoop, you would buy more.  
Because the quantity demanded falls as the price rises and rises as the price falls,  
we say that the quantity demanded is negatively related to the price. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is true for most goods in the economy and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call it the law of demand:   
Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of the  
good falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises

### Shifts in the Demand Curve

Shift the demand curve to the right and is called an  
***increase in demand***. Any change that reduces the quantity demanded at every  
price shifts the demand curve to the left and is called a ***decrease in demand***

We now turn to the other side of the [market ](https://calibremarkets.africa/index.php/2022/12/22/global-economy-is-slowly-recovering/)and examine the behavior of sellers.  
Once again, to focus our thinking, lets consider the market for ice cream.

## The Supply Cuve: The Relationship between Price  
and Quantity Supplied

  
The quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are will-  
ing and able to sell. There are many determinants of quantity supplied,  
again, price plays a special role in our analysis.

When the price of ice cream is high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so the quantity supplied is large. Sellers of ice cream work long hours, buy many ice-cream machines, and hire many workers. By contrast, when the price of ice cream is low, the business is less profitable, and so sellers produce less ice cream. At a low price, some sellers may wen choose to shut down, and their quantity supplied falls to zero.  
Because the quantity supplied rises as the price rises and falls as the price falls, we say that the quantity supplied is positively related to the price of the good. This relationship between price and quantity supplied is called the ***law of supply***: Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good also rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls as well,

## Shifts in the Supply Curve

The supply curve shifts to the right if there is a change that increases the quantity that sellers intend to produce at a particular price.
