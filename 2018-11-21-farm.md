When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.\t\t"

Earlier this week, Cardi announced a new single “WAP” featuring Megan thee Stallion, marking it the first time the rappers have collaborated. And, in true Cardi fashion, the announced included great visuals, with a single cover of Cardi and Megan donning BAP-style updos with gold nameplate hoops that read WAP. Last night, Cardi and Meghan finally dropped a full music video for the single with a plethora of fashion and beauty looks that we’ll be talking about forever.

Cardi’s stylist Kollin Carter and Megan’s stylist EJ King worked together to bring this vision to life from custom Mugler looks to zebra print bodysuits. While Tokyo Stylez and Kellon Deryck created all of the extravagant hairstyles. The theme was definitely camp, from the updo hairstyles and excessive animal print to the latex, with an obvious homage to rappers like Lil Kim and stylist Misa Hylton. Then there were the cameos from celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Normani, and Rosalia. We’ve already watched the “WAP” video at least 10 times, here are our favorite looks.

### Matching Neon Bodysuits and BAPS Updos

At Clarke’s On the Table, Workshops with a Purpose and virtual Bree Blooms workshops, participants are provided flowers and vases and to make arrangements. “We create a safe place for uncomfortable conversations about racism, diversity, equality and identity,” Clarke said.

The Little House Project’s Little House on Routh and Little House of Bishop Arts are small events spaces lovingly restored by the Clarkes. “We open in areas that are gentrified. We make sure there’s a place for Blacks. The uptown location is predominantly white and the house used to be slave quarters,” Clarke said of Routh. “I thought it would be cool to take something that had so much pain and bring some light to it.

“In 2020, it’s okay to, say, ‘racism’ and ‘race.’ Diversity and inclusion are the safe words,” said Clarke. “My workshops launched nationally. Now, it’s not a local message, I’m reaching people all over. I’m able to create with my hands and my heart, and I’m bettering the community and society.”
