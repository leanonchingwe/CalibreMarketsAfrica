Of all the trend indicators, the alligator indicator is the most intriguing. It was introduced by Bill Williams, a well-known and accomplished trader and the creator of the Chaos Theory. His indication is odd not just because of its name but also because it exhibits all animal traits, such as the ability to “sleep” or “open its mouth” in response to hunger. The practical significance of these two indicator characteristics is that they serve as trading signals for when to avoid trading (when an alligator is asleep) and when to trade in the direction of an open mouth.

Let’s attempt to comprehend it. The indicator is built on three moving averages, each with a different time offset for some bars, which is the first thing you should be aware of. The normal settings for the indication will be as follows:

The Alligator’s Jaw is a 13-period smoothed moving average (SMMA) constructed from the bar average value, which is the sum of the highest and minimum prices divided by two and advanced by 8 bars;

2\) The Alligator’s Teeth is an 8-period SMMA constructed on a median price and advanced by 5 bars in time;

3\) The Alligator’s Lips is a smoothed moving average (SMMA) of five periods that has been advanced by three bars.

Here is an illustration of the installation settings for Alligator:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://calibremarkets.africa/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/alligator-1024x430.png)</figure>If there is no trend, this indicator was designed to weed out spurious signals. During a flat, moving averages can produce a lot of false signals. The adjusted averages that moved into the future allowed you to start or stop trading on time, just as the Alligator author had predicted. We should research the alligator’s sleeping and waking patterns in order to comprehend how to do it.

The major indication to purchase calls or puts is when the “mouth opens,” or when the averages start to diverge and cease crossing. The averages’ movement dictates which way a deal should be opened: if they go higher, that’s a signal to trade online; if they move downward, that’s a signal to purchase options. an indication .Shutting the mouth,” or the point when the moving averages start to close and cross, will be a hint that your deal is about to be closed. The chart shows the following example:

Online trading is possible when the price chart is above the indication; in the other case, when the price chart is below the indicator, put purchases are possible.

Installing the indicator on your chart and testing its signals against the quotations history is advised if you want to understand how the indicator functions. Such practice enables you to become familiar with and comprehend a currency pair’s signals. On a real-time chart, you can also see trade signs.

Online trading in short bursts enables you to comprehend how the indication functions.
